# Data Structures and Algorithms
This repo contains everything I'm currently practicing on DSA

## What i have Learnt so far
- Merge Sort Algorithm
- Quick Sort Algorithm
- Selection Sort Algorithm
- Binary Search Algorithm
- Linear Search Algorithm
- How to Create a LinkedList
- Merge Sort Implementation on LinkedList

## How to use
delete the `values/sorted_names.txt` file and run `sorting_algorithm/sort_names.py` to create a new sorted list of names.

You can also run the `search_algorithm/search_names.py` file to see how binary search is used to search for names in a txt file
